Enterprise Library is a collection of application blocks designed to assist developers with common enterprise development
challenges. Originally developed by [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/dn169621(v=pandp.10)), it was abandoned in 2013, but released as Open Source, originally on
CodePlex and then moved to GitHub when CodePlex was shut down.

This [Enterprise Library GitHub project](https://github.com/EnterpriseLibrary) took to revive the Enterprise Library
project, in order to support projects that already use it, and provide a solution to common problems in new projects.

There are currently several parts, or Application Blocks, as they are called, to Enterprise Library:
1. Data Access Application Block
  * [API Reference](/daab)
2. Logging Application Block
3. Semantic Logging Application Block
4. Exception Handling Application Block
5. Validation Application Block
6. Transient Fault Handling Application Block
7. Policy Injection Application Block
