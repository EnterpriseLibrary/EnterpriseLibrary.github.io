Enterprise Library is a collection of application blocks designed to assist developers with common enterprise development challenges. Orignially developed by Microsoft, it was abandoned in 2013, but released as Open Source, originally on CodePlex and then moved to GitHub when CodePlex was shut down.

1. Data Access Application Block
2. Logging Application Block
3. Semantic Logging Application Block
4. Exception Handling Application Block
5. Validation Application Block
6. Transient Fault Handling Application Block
7. Policy Injection Application Block
